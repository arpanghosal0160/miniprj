Summary of my name is Arpan.txt:
In the forests of the ancient kingdom of Andara, a village called Thirel exists, home to the legend of the Echo Stone, a mystical relic that holds the memories of the land. Eira, a curious 17-year-old girl, stumbles upon the Echo Stone in a hidden cave and touches it, experiencing the memories of wars, betrayals, and long-forgotten truths. Returning to Thirel, she finds that only Old Mara, the village elder, believes her. Eira uncovers a hidden scroll in the ruins of Varek Castle that reveals her connection to the Echo Stone's history and her true identity. She becomes the guardian of Andara's memories, sharing them with neighboring kingdoms and ushering in a new era of truth and justice.
